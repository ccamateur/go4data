# Workflow

Workflow is a dataflow automazation tool. 
It constists of 2 components. 
There are Processors which are the default component. Processors are used to transport data between
one another. They can be used to manage the data pipeline. 
A processor can publish to many topics or subscribe to many topics.
It uses a Pub/Sub system to manage how data flows between processors.

A processor cannot do any data processing by itself. Each processor has a Handler assigned to it, it is this handler that does the processing.
A Handler has to be assigned to start a processor.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/percybolmer/workflow
```

## Usage
Soon an Examples folder is comming with better examples

```golang
readFileProc := NewProcessor("readfile", "file_data")
handler := files.NewReadFileHandler()
readFileProc.SetHandler(handler)

if err := readFileProc.Start(context.Background()); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```
